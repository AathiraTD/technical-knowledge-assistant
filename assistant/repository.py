"""The storage boundary.

The answer engine depends on this Protocol, never on a database. Two adapters
implement it:

  EmbeddedRepository  SQLite — ships with the submission, runs offline, no service
  PostgresRepository  PostgreSQL + pgvector — the deployment target

The schema and the version semantics are the same in both; only the dialect and
the similarity operator differ. That is what makes the demonstration path and
the production path the same system rather than two systems that resemble each
other.
